\section{Introduction}
Both Windows and Linux/Unix support a number of system calls to
allow a range of interactions with the kernel.

\section{System calls in Linux/Unix}
Linux kernel supports ~200 system calls, these system calls are
similar among different Unix based kernels. Common system calls for
Unix/Linux are listed in Table \ref{table:linux-syscalls}:

\section{System calls in Windows}
Windows kernel supports ~250 system calls, these system calls'
functions range from memory management to process control including
inter-process communication, security and I/O handling. Common system
calls for Windows kernel are listed in Table \ref{table:windows-syscalls}:

    \textbf{System Call} & \textbf{Function} \\ [0.5ex] 

    \hline\hline

    exit & Exit syscall is used to terminate the current process \\
    
    \hline fork & Creates a copy of the current process as the child
    of the process that called fork \\

    \hline write & Write content from a buffer to either a file or a
    device \\

    \hline open & Open system call allows either to open a file,
    create one if it doesn't exist or truncate to an existing file
    \\

    \hline close & Closes a file descriptor \\

    \hline chdir & Changes the current working directory of the
    process \\

    \hline execve & Executes a program by overwriting the caller
    program, this system call in combination with fork allows
    execution of a program as a child process\\

    \hline ExitProcess & Terminates current process \\

    \hline CreateFile & Creates a new file at the specified path \\

    \hline ReadFile & Reads specified number of bytes from a file
                      handler to a buffer \\

    \hline WriteFile & Writes specified number of bytes from a buffer
                       to a file handler \\

    \hline CloseHandle & Closes an already opened file handler \\

    \hline SetTimer & Calls a specified function after certain number of milliseconds \\

    \hline ReadConsole & Reads characters from the console input buffer and removes them from it\\

    \hline WriteConsole & Writes at the cursor location a character string \\
